AMBIANCE -- audience engagment detection

"see how artist set the vibe"

P1

- EDM DJ sets are often dynamic and feed off the audience energy

- part of the "set experience" includes the periperal sensory equipment (non-music), primarily lights

- artist needs more control over to sync the entire stage energy to their music

P2 

- Main stages are theme-based and havea a lotof uprfont cost, coordination and are too rigid to tailor to each set

- rigid levels are due to cost, the rigs need to be generic enough for mulitiple uses

- high technical expertise required to modify

P3

- Allow Dj some "vibe setting" priveldges

- thsi will help them engage the crowd more at the level that matches with audio sets they are going towards

- thiss will maximize crowd engagement for ultimate experience

P4

- we could extend the ML and AI use of the DeepLens intatake

- for now we only collect crowd sentiment and motion detection

- will use data from the audience mobility to prodcuce DJ show rankings of up and coming DJ's 

idea "dynamic DJ experience" feedback of the moment you are creating

our device gets frames, computes the scores locally and then sends to the IoT information to AWS -- which then sets off the actions you want

modifes the lights show based on what the crowd is feeling -- if you want more lit then go more lit, if more mellow  then go more mellow

gives a score of how the crowd is doing

you want the DJ to get semi empirical feedback on the crowd -- what vibe do they want are they getting that outcome 

// does vibe flow

that way they can alter the effects 

Incedental use of Data

host/DJ use of data

: how mamy people showed up to the set?

    -match it up with set times and know who pulled attendance

: how engaged was the crows during the set?

    - see what songs were the most lit etc

: get a body count /count fluctuation

    

What is DeepLens?

IoT device that takes in frames and analyses the frames then emits json to AWS servers (optimal for low network usage) / but can also send video over the network/wire for AWS ML api by sending frame by frame

what do we have AWS api's and the ML models that are loaded directly onto the device

What do we want to achieve?

get the crowd and the DJ to be dynamic with each other

ie the DJ can see the crowd's reaction to the music and adjust // or change stage settings to influence how the crowd behaves

how? 

DeepLens -- enhances proximity and geofencint technology

new lineup combinations to attract more new audiences

stages want a specific theme tied to their ambiance // DJ wants to enhance their performance 

compromise -- have a ambiance MODES 3 modes of audience engagment 

stage timeline -- 

Average display can take up to -- 

750 lights, 1,600 2'-by-2' video tiles 110 strobe lights, 220 moving lights, and 600 LEDs.

 He remembers spending $300,000 on lights and design for the entire festival back in the early 2000s. 

Today's main stage budgets alone run in the millions, bolstered by increased ticket prices, sales, and increasingly lucrative sponsorship deals as electronic music continues its domination of mainstream entertainment.

AMBIANCE -- artist gets more control over the stage experience, music is the main driving force, ambiance would enhance the experience the DJ wants to invoke

dynamic staging -- dj has a say on the senory stimulus, primarily lights and can include other senory effects like co2 tanks and 

major production stages like EDC main stage take million to arrange and use high-end devices and arrays not readily available to the light markets at large. additionally each stage at EDC has a distinct theme or sub-genre that it's catering towards. thus most light shows or visuals are at the hands of the stage director and have small input on what the artist will play.  

DJ tend to play dynamic sets that feed off the energy of the audience, the lights setup takes heavy pre-planning and are usually already pre-programmed sequences.

AMBIANCE will give the artist the ablilty to ensure the peripheral senory experience aligns with atmospheere the are going for. 

each stage has a theme but each artist has their own fluctuations

with ambiance the artist can control the intensity of the peripherals, medium, high, ludacris

this improves the audience engagement, while also providing the artist with a visual on crowd engagment

each artist has their own taste in light

The biggest of the festival's eight stages, the 440 feet wide, 700-ton design carried a $3 million price tag that was highlighted by a 90 foot, LED encrusted tree. The stage also featured custom fountains, 33 flame torches, and 1,400 lighting fixtures.

tour parts of it's production -- meaning it will not have to re-create productions in smaller markets / shows

One possibility is to build site-specific stages that would be unique to each market and could be used for more than one 12-month cycle.

ut we are right now considering building a larger production, using it for multiple years and having each market have its own look so that the traveler has the reason to go somewhere and experience something they've never experienced before."

You have to have a broad understanding of the big picture, from the site plan, to obviously the budget and fiscal responsibility, and then artist riders, time constraints and available resources. Then on top of that there is a very delicate balance between engineering and science and the artistic vision and the creative side of it.

Being able to draw a pretty picture does not necessarily translate into something that can be built, and drawing a pretty picture that can that can be built in the United States doesn't necessarily mean it can be built in Brazil.

. You have to understand where you're working and what's available to you ... that's how you develop the creative process. For me it's mental, so I'll start thinking about where I want to go, and then it's a sketch book. Then from the sketchbook it goes into the computer and then from the computer we start rendering and start modeling and it's an ongoing process.

400,000 gathering for EDC Las Vegas 2017 

I remember even 10 years ago with Insomniac, the (budget) I spent on producing 10 stages for [owner] Pasqualle [Rotella] is probably what we spend on one stage now, and a small stage,

It all comes down to supply and demand. As the dance community swells, so too do the budgets. EDC ticket-buyers are willing to spend more, so Lieberman and his team can pump more money into bigger, better attractions.

Some artists have more strict demands for others. Save for one song, Knife Party doesn't want to see anything but red light. Carnage only likes to use four distinct colors at a time. Richie Hawtin has a distinct vision for how his visuals and music interact. It's not easy to make all 20-plus artists on one stage happy, but it's his years of experience and ability to adapt that make Lieberman and his team the go-to in their industry.

Designs can go through as many as 20 reiterations, and each of those can fall victim to three or four rewrites
