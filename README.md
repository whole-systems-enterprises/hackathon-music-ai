Hackathon for Music and AI, specifically Amazon DeepLens, AWS SageMaker, and AWS Rekognition - Los Angeles, California, United States - 5-6 May 2018.

# Project

We delivered a platform for measuring crowd enthusiasm during music festivals, at concerts, and at discoteques.

# Why This Is Important

Our time-dependent measurements offer the following advantages:

    - metrics for concert booking agencies and venues
    - realtime feedback for performers
    - metrics for controlling lights and even the music itself during performances
    - metrics for evaluating event costs
